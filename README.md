# AngularJS-Website-Conversion
I took a bootstrap html page, and converted some of the html code into AngularJS to better understand Angular and its Awesomeness.

This is the Angular Code to my website: herbyslife.me

I wanted to get a feel of AngularJS. This form of javascript is becoming widely used, due to it's easy two-way binding feature of data from the front end, to the back end of the code. Granted I do not do any data binding on my site, but I was able to remove a ton of html code, and recreate the code dynamically in AngularJS. That was the purpose of this small and simple project.
